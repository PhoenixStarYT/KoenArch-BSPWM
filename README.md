# KoenArch-BSPWM

Arch Linux post-install scripts for AwesomeWM, BSPWM, and KDE Plasma

## Introduction

This script is dedicated to people who want an easy way to get started with a tiling window manager, or just Arch Linux in general.
The scripts will install everything from the Desktop itself, some themes, some fonts that I use,
and some other applications to make Arch Linux about as easy to get into as it could get.

## Installation

Start by cloning the GitHub repository, and run the install script using the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phoenixstaryt/koenarch-bspwm
./install.sh
```
During the installation process, you will be prompted to put in your password before proceeding.
